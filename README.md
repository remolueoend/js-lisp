# JS-LISP

Fun-project for playing around with Lisp-alike array-based Javascript expressions.

The idea is to express a whole program using only javascript arrays, and - where necessary - arrow functions.

The core of this project is a function called `evalExp<R>(Expression): R` located at `./core.js`, accepting an array-based expression and returning the resolved value.

This project might help me to understand the advantages of Lisp-related languages, especially in context of meta-programming.

Check out `./index.js` for some basic examples.
